Valorant AI Trigger bot 


Need to clone the Yolov5 repository to do the object detection validation. Best pt contains the weights for a trained model on classes enemey head and enemy body. This program grabs screenshots and feeds them to the the model to recognize enemy heads and
shoots if the head is on the center of the screen. 3070ti Gets around 50 fps with the model detection, and with a faster GPU getting around 144+ fps is optimal for a production level trigger bot.
